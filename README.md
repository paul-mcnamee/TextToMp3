# TextToMp3

## Background 
I lost my loot filter sounds for Path of Exile so I had to re-generate them, writing this program was quicker than generating them manually. 

## Instructions
Change the file names and the associated text to speech strings in the entries.json file, build the project, and run the exe.
The entries.json file is copied (if newer) when the build happens.
The mp3 files will be in the newly created output directory located in the top level of the built project (TextToMp3\bin\Debug\net8.0\output).
